                        You can request an appointment online or call us at 833-920-3234. International patients can call 212-639-4900 or use AT&T Direct Access by dialing the access number for the country you are calling from, then dialing 888-675-7722.

                        You don’t need a referral to make an appointment. The representatives who staff our appointment lines are knowledgeable, well trained, and sensitive, and they can answer many of your questions.

                        You don’t need any inside knowledge or personal ties to reach out to us. While we are a world-renowned cancer hospital, anyone can call us. You don’t need an “in” to be treated here.

                        You don’t have to have a rare cancer. It’s true that we’re world leaders in treating many of the most complex, challenging types of the disease. But our compassionate, comprehensive approach to care can make a big difference to people with the most common forms of cancer, too, including breast, lung, and prostate cancers. Oftentimes, our experts are able to offer treatment options that are more effective or that can improve your quality of life.

                        You can receive care that’s closer to home. While some treatments can only be given at our main locations in New York City, more and more patients are receiving the vast majority of their care at our regional care locations in New York State and New Jersey. Our care advisers can discuss what services are offered in the location that’s most convenient for you.

                        If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with cancer, contact our Patient Access Service for an appointment at one of our locations or from your own home via telemedicine. No referral necessary.

                        It’s natural to be anxious when you make the first call. And you may have a lot of questions — questions about treatment, insurance coverage, or clinical trials, or what services are offered near you. We’ll do everything we can to put you at ease, whether you’re a patient or a caregiver, and make sure you get the answers you need.

                        The service is staffed by specially trained oncology nurses and care advisors who work very closely with our physicians. We’ll make certain we refer you to the healthcare provider best suited to your particular diagnosis — whether your first appointment is with a surgeon, a medical oncologist, or a radiation oncologist.</p>
